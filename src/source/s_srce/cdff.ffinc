      REAL(KIND=WP) FUNCTION CDFF(F, DF1, DF2)
!
!     LATEST REVISION  -  03/15/90  (JRD)
!
!     THIS ROUTINE COMPUTES THE CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION FOR
!     THE F DISTRIBUTION.  THE APPROXIMATION USED DEPENDS ON THE
!     DEGREES OF FREEDOM IN THE NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR.
!     1.  IF BOTH DEGREES OF FREEDOM ARE SMALL (LESS THAN 4000),
!         THE CDF IS COMPUTED FROM THE INCOMPLETE BETA FUNCTION
!         USING EQUATION 5.45 OF STATISTICAL COMPUTING, BY KENNEDY AND
!         GENTLE.
!     2.  IF ONE OF THE DEGREES OF FREEDOM IS LARGE (GREATER THAN OR
!         EQUAL TO 4000) AND THE OTHER IS MODERATELY LARGE (GREATER THAN
!         OR EQUAL TO 100), THE CDF IS APPROXIMATED BY A NORMAL DISTRIB-
!         BUTION AS SHOWN IN EQUATION 20 ON PAGE 83 OF DISTRIBUTIONS IN
!         STATISTICS - CONTINUOUS UNIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS - 2, BY
!         JOHNSON AND KOTZ.
!     3.  IF ONE OF THE DEGREES OF FREEDOM IS SMALL (LESS THAN 100) AND
!         THE OTHER IS LARGE (EXCEEDING 4000), THE CDF IS APPROXIMATED
!         BY A CHI SQUARED DISTRIBUTION AS SHOWN IN THE THIRD EQUATION
!         ON PAGE 84 OF DISTRIBUTIONS IN STATISTICS - CONTINUOUS
!         UNIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS - 2, BY JOHNSON AND KOTZ.

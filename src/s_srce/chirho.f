C
C     REAL CHI, CHIP
C        THE VARIABLES IN WHICH THE CHI SQUARE STATISTIC AND
C        CHI SQUARE STATISTIC PROBABILITY ARE STORED.
C     INTEGER LAG
C        THE INDEXING VARIABLE INDICATING THE LAG VALUE OF THE
C        AUTOCORRELATION BEING EXAMINED.
C     INTEGER N
C        THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS IN THE SERIES.
C     INTEGER NC
C        THE NUMBER OF AUTOCORRELATIONS COMPUTED.
C     REAL RHO(NC)
C        THE ARRAY IN WHICH THE AUTOCORRELATIONS ARE STORED
C
      CHI = 0.0E0
      DO 10 LAG = 1, NC
         CHI = CHI + RHO(LAG) * RHO(LAG)

                               STARPAC 2.08
              The Standards Time Series and Regression Package


 STARPAC 2.08 is a library of portable Fortran subprograms for conducting
 statistical analysis.  It was developed and is maintained by the Center for
 Computing and Applied Mathematics of the National Institute of Standards and
 Technology (formerly the National Bureau of Standards).  STARPAC contains
 subprogram groups for performing time series analysis and nonlinear least
 squares regression, as well as normal random number generation, line printer
 plots, basic statistical analyses, and linear least squares.

 Currently, the primary mode of distribution for STARPAC is magnetic tape.
 The tape release package consists of the 11 files contained in this directory:

        1  TOC.DOC      - tape characteristics, file structure and
                          table of contents 
                          (3318 bytes)

        2  INSTALL.DOC  - the installation manual
                          (59735 bytes)

        3  S_SRCE.FOR   - single precision STARPAC 2.08 source code, excluding
                          code from various public domain sources
                          (2575385 bytes)

        4  S_NL2SOL.FOR - single precision STARPAC 2.08 source code from NL2SOL
                          (194141 bytes)

        5  D_SRCE.FOR   - double precision STARPAC 2.08 source code, excluding
                          code from various public domain sources
                          (2628509 bytes)

        6  D_NL2SOL.FOR - double precision STARPAC 2.08 source code from NL2SOL
                          (195881 bytes)

        7  MISC.FOR     - single and double precision subprograms from
                          miscellaneous public domain sources, but excluding
                          code from NL2SOL, LINPACK and BLAS and excluding
                          subprograms supplying machine dependent constants
                          (118434 bytes)

        8  LPK_BLS.FOR  - single and double precision subprograms
                          from LINPACK and BLAS
                          (76661 bytes)

        9  MDC.FOR      - single and double precision subprograms supplying
                          machine dependent constants
                          (47665 bytes)

       10  TEST.OUT     - results of test subprograms
                          (349444 bytes)

       11  GUIDE.DOC    - STARPAC 2.08 user documentation, 
                          in line printer format
                          (847693 bytes)

 File TOC.DOC is obviously not needed when the files are acquired via FTP.
 File INSTALL.DOC contains a more detailed description of the STARPAC files and
 of the installation process; installers may wish to read it before
 transmitting the remaining files.

 Before proceeding to acquire the STARPAC files, installers should note that
 although STARPAC is supplied in both single and double precision versions, the
 two versions cannot be used together.  This is because the names of most of
 the subprograms are the same in the two versions.  As is documented in the
 Installation Guide, most sites will want to install only one of the two
 versions.  Transmission time can therefore be reduced if the source files for
 only one version are transmitted.

   *  For the single precision version, the source files
          S_SRCE.FOR, S_NL2SOL.FOR, MISC.FOR, LPK_BLS.FOR and MDC.FOR 
      should be used.

   *  For the double precision version, the source files 
          D_SRCE.FOR, D_NL2SOL.FOR, MISC.FOR, LPK_BLS.FOR and MDC.FOR 
      should be used.  

 Files INSTALL.DOC, GUIDE.DOC and TEST.OUT will be needed by all sites.

 It is particularly important that the STARPAC developers be notified that you
 have acquired STARPAC when the package is obtained via FTP.  Without such
 notification, we will not know that your site should receive future notices
 and updates.  Notification can be accomplished either by filling out and
 returning the registration form at the end of the Installation Guide, or by
 sending an e-mail message containing the recipient's name, address, phone
 number and e-mail address to

 *** PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TAPE

      A.  ASCII character set.
      B.  1600 cpi density.
      C.  Unlabeled.
      D.  11 files, each terminated by tapemarks.
      E.  Additional tapemark follows tapemark of last file.
      F.  Files consist of 1 or more blocks (physical records).
      G.  Files 1 to 9 have blocks of
          45 line images (logical records) of 80 characters each,
          i.e., 3600 characters;
      H.  Files 10 and 11 have blocks of
          20 line images (logical records) of 132 characters each,
          i.e., 2640 characters;
      I.  Last block of a file may contain fewer than the specified number of
          line images, in which case it is short, not blank filled.

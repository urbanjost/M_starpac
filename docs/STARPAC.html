<b>STARPAC</b> is a free, portable library of Fortran routines for statistical
data analysis from the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).
"STARPAC" is an acronym for "Standards Time Series and Regression Package".  
The package contains computational routines for normal random number
generation, univariate sampling, one-way analysis of variance, correlation 
analysis, linear least squares, nonlinear least squares, digital filtering, 
complex demodulation, correlation and spectrum analysis, and time series 
analysis.
<p>
<i>Recommendation:</i> STARPAC is the best free, general purpose statistical
library in our experience.

Documentation: See the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ucar.edu/starpac/guide.doc">User's Guide to STARPAC</a>
for a thorough discussion of the library and its routines.  See the README file 
in the <a href="ftp://ftp.ucar.edu/starpac/">STARPAC directory</a> for an 
overview of the library.  There is also an installer's guide in the directory.

NCAR users: the STARPAC binary library is available to NCAR computer users, 
for linking with Fortran programs, on some of SCD's compute-servers.  See
<a href="http://www.scd.ucar.edu/docs/products">"SCD Computers, Products, and Libraries"</a> for the names of those computers.  
If you have questions about linking the binary library on these NCAR systems, 
please see
